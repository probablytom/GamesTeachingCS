GamesTeachingCS
===============

A record of research evidence and documentation for a paper on teaching through games, particularly in Computer Science. 


Status
======

This project is still currently under construction. It is my aim to collect data over the next month or two (Until March 2015) with an aim to finish writing around May 2015. 


Method
======

The data for the project will be collected by way of visiting schools in person and running sessions with pupils. It is possible that some interested peers will also run some sessions and collect data, as there is some interest in this project from outside observers.
The data will be collected by way of having one set of pupils (chosen randomly) play the game together, and one set of pupils having a lesson at the same time in another room, by the traditional method their teacher uses. 
After this, a test will be administered and the pupils' understanding measured.
